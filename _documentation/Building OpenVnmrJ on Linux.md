## Building OVJ on Linux

See README.ovj  
v0.3  
11 September 2015  
*Dan Iverson & John Ryan*  

### BUILD REQUIREMENTS


### EL6 (RHEL/CentOS 6)

The minimum package requirement for EL6 assumes that your system was installed with the
"Software Development Workstation" package selection as required by VnmrJ.  This build
configuration has been tested on CentOS 6.6 but should work for any RHEL or CentOS 6.x.
```
yum install compat-gcc-34-g77 glibc-devel.i686 libstdc++.i686 libX11-devel.i686 libXt-devel.i686 openmotif-devel.i686 scons
```

Optionally, you can also install gsl-devel and libtiff-devel if you wish to compile using the GNU
scientific library.  Code compiled with the GSL will be subject to license restrictions.

### Ubuntu Trusty Tahr 14.04 LTS
The minimum package requirement for Ubuntu Trusty Tahr 14.04 LTS assumes that you have
installed the standard desktop edition of Ubuntu.  A minimal install may require additional
packages including but not limited to make, unzip and zip.  This build configuration has been
tested on Ubuntu but should work for any *buntu Trusty Tahr 14.04 LTS distribution.
```
sudo apt-get install fort77 g++ lib32stdc++-4.8-dev libc6-dev-i386 libglu1-mesa-dev libmotif-dev:i386 libx11-dev:i386 libxt-dev:i386 scons
```
Optionally, you can also install libgsl0-dev and libtiff5-dev if you wish to compile 
components using the GNU scientific library.  Code compiled with the GSL will be subject
to license restrictions.

Full package requirements including dependent packages are listed in the appendix of
this document.

### INSTALLATION & COMPILATION

Make a directory. Lets call it ovjbuild.  unzip the source code file inside that directory.
It will add a git-repo. The git-repo directory contains the following directories and files.
These files may be open-sourced.

SConstruct   This is the definition file used by scons. It is similar to Makefile used by
             the make command.
scripts      This contains tools used by scons.
src          This contains the source code for OpenVnmrJ. Some of these directories also
             contain a SConstruct file that is used to build / compile that specific
             program.

The ovjTools can be unzipped in the ovjbuild directory or anyplace that you want to put it.
The ovjTools directory contains code from external sources. This code should not be
open-sourced by OpenVnmrJ. It contains the following directories. (In earlier edition,
this was the 3rdParty directory.

- fftw           Used by xrecon (imaging program)
- fftw_mac       Used by xrecon MacOS version (imaging program)
- gsllibs        Used by programs in bin_image
- java           Used by all java programs. It is a soft link to the java jdk.
- JavaPackages   Used by vjmol and vnmrj
- jdk1.6.0_39_64 Java jdk.
- JMF-2.1.1e     Used by vnmrj (simplemovie.jar)
- junit          Used by apt, probeid, and vjclient
- NDDS           Used by nvlocki, nvexpproc, nvinfoproc, nvrecvproc, nvsendproc
- pgsql          Postgress / Locator code
- tcl            This contains headers and libraries for compiling programs that require tcl (Roboproc)

We compile VnmrJ java programs with jdk1.6.0_39_64. The java in ovjTools should be a soft link
to the actual java JDK. 

At the same level as the git-repo directory, do the following
```
  mkdir bin
  cp git-repo/src/scripts/buildovj bin
  cp git-repo/src/scripts/makeovj bin
  cd bin
```
Edit the buildovj script and set the ovjBuildDir and OVJ_TOOLS parameters for your
environment. The OVJ_TOOLS parameter should point to the ovjTools directory. The ovjTools
directory does not necessarily need to be in the same directory as the git-repo directory,
although that may be a convenient place.

Other options are described in that file but the defaults should be okay. The buildovj script collects all the options and the makeovj script does all the work. In general, the makeovj script does three things. The first is to update the sources from git. Since we are not yet actually using git, this part is turned off (doGitClone=no).
The second part compiles everything. This step is equivalent to what was done in the previous two versions of OVJ (doScons=yes). The third part collects files into the DVD images
(buildOVJ=yes).

Run the command
```
  ./buildovj
```
This command will compile the entire OVJ package. It will use the SConstruct file to  compile the programs in src and place the results in directories at the same level as the git-repo level. The console directory will contain console-specific files.

The vnmr directory will contain files that are generic. The options directory contains optional software and code that may be optionally installed.  If the buildOVJ and / or
buildOVJMI parameters are set to yes in the buildovj script, additional directories will be built that are an image of the DVD installer. A log of the build process will be placed in a logs direcory. In summary, before running the buildovj script, your build directory will have bin, git-repo, and ovjTools directories.  If you have previously run the buildovj script, there will also be console, logs, options, and vnmr directories.
Depending on your selections in the buildovj script, the default DVD images dvdimageOVJ and dvdimageOVJMI may also be present. When the buildovj script is executed, one of the first things it does is remove any preexisting console, options, vnmr, and dvd image directories.

You can also change into specific directories in src and run scons. That will build that specific program. To compile the java programs, the OVJ_TOOLS env parameter must be set to point to the ovjTools directory. In a bash shell, the command would be
`
  export OVJ_TOOLS=<path>
  `
In a csh, the command would be
`
  setenv OVJ_TOOLS <path>
`
For example,
```
cd git-repo/src/vnmrbg
scons
```
will build only the Vnmrbg program.

For Linux systems:
Once the buildovj script is complete, and you had selected the buildOVJ and / or buildOVJMI parameters, you can cd dvdimageOVJ or dvdimageOVJMI and run ./load.nmr to install a complete
OpenVnmrJ package. If a prior VJ42 install is present (/vnmr is a symbolic link to the VJ42 installation), then the OpenVnmrJ installation will collect various files from the VJ42 install so that the OpenVnmrJ install should be complete.  See the src/scripts/update_OpenVnmrJ.sh
script. Assuming the VJ42 directory was available, this installed OVJ should be a complete system capable of data acquisition. After installation, the only thing that should be needed is `su acqproc` to start the OVJ version of the procs.

For MacOS systems:
Once the buildovj script is complete, and you had selected the buildOVJ parameter, you will have a dvd image that is constructed so that the MacOS utility PackageMaker can be
used to build a MacOS installer. Instructions for building the installer are in `git-repo/src/macos/readme_packagemaker`. If a prior VJ42 install is present (/vnmr is a symbolic link to the VJ42 installation), then the OpenVnmrJ installation will collect various files from the VJ42 install so that the OpenVnmrJ install should be complete.

The src directory has a number of subdirectories. In general, each subdirectory corresponds to one or more programs that need to be compiled. Some of the subdirectories contain code that is shared by several programs. Some directories also contain a special sconsPostAction
file. These typically are a shell script with symbolic link commands. For example, src/common/maclib has a sconsPostAction files which creates aliases of some of the macros.
The SConstuct must explicitly execute the sconsPostAction. See the git-repo/SConstruct file
for an example.
