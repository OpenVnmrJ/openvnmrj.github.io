## Documentation

### Who we are

The OpenVnmrJ project is a community that revolves around OpenVnmrJ as a piece of software. OpenVnmrJ resulted from the open-source release of commercial software for NMR spectrometers and MRI scanners. We are a group of NMR/MRI instrument users and open-source developers who develop, use, document, and promote OpenVnmrJ, NMR/MRI instruments and data stations running OpenVnmrJ, and other related activities for our mutual benefit.

See [OpenVnmrJ](http://openvnmrj.org) for more information.  

### OpenVnmrJ

OpenVnmrJ is the outsourced parts of VnmrJ 4.2, used for NMR Data processing and acquisition. For release information and supported operating systems, see the  [GitHub OpenVnmrJ](https://github.com/OpenVnmrJ) repository.

OpenVnmrJ is designed to be very extensible with:  
- A rich set of macros, written in MAGICAL
- A very configurable interface, using XML assets
- A comprehensive library of pulse programs, written in C, usually with macros and XML files to ease setting up experiments and processing data
- All these are open sourced and can use help to maintain code, fix bugs, add new features, and improve the user experience for all uses of OpenVnmrJ.

### Using this repository

This repository is for people that want to download, compile, fix and contribute back to the community. 

If you only want to download and run OpenVnmrJ, you should get a pre-built archive and install a local copy. See [Downloading](/Downloading) for more information.

### Spectrometer users, read this

* OpenVnmrJ can be used for spectrometer control if VnmrJ 4.2 is installed but 
  * ** Do not delete the Agilent supplied VnmrJ on your spectrometer **
  * Agilent service requires VnmrJ 4.2
* The spectrometer console software is NOT open sourced
* If a copy of VnmrJ 4.2 is found during installation, the spectrometer acquisition components will be copied into OpenVnmrJ
