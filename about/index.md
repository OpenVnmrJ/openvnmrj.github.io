## Who we are ##

The OpenVnmrJ project as a community revolves around OpenVnmrJ as a
piece of software. OpenVnmrJ resulted from the open-source release of
commercial software for NMR spectrometers. We are a group of
open-source developers and users who develop, use, document, and
promote OpenVnmrJ, NMR spectrometers and data stations running
OpenVnmrJ, and other related activities for our mutual benefit.

See OpenVnmrJ [Background](/Background/) for more information

## OpenVnmrJ ##

OpenVnmrJ is the Open Source parts of VnmrJ 4.2, used for NMR Data
processing and acquisition. The software runs on Linux: Centos 6 and
Ubuntu 14.02, Trusty Tahr are the currently targetted hosts. As a
datastation, the software runs on OS X 10.09 to 10.11.

OpenVnmrJ is designed to be very extensible with:

- A rich set of macros, written in MAGICAL
- A very configurable interface, using XML assets
- A comprehensive library of pulse programs, written in C, usually
  with macros and XML files to ease setting up experiments and
  processing data
- All these are open sourced and can use help to maintain code, fix
  bugs, add new features, and improve the user experience for all uses
  of OpenVnmrJ.

## Using the GitHub Repository ##

The GitHub repository is for people that want to download, compile,
fix and contribute back to the community.

If you only want to download and run OpenVnmrJ, you should get a
pre-built archive and install a local copy. See
[Downloading](/Downloading/) for more information.

## Spectrometer users, read this ##

** Do not delete the Agilent supplied VnmrJ on your spectrometer **
* Agilent service requires VnmrJ 4.2
* The spectrometer console software is NOT open sourced
